* Investment banking has experienced some of the fastest growth in the financial industry in the past 5 years thanks to the introduction of AI with a focus on decision support and natural language processing. Unstructured data collection has also been on the forefront of the fintech take over of the investment banking industry. The introduction and continued research in blockchain has made a huge splash with its decentralized database. Virtual data rooms and relationship management has also seen large advances in the past few years. 

Commercial banking has also experienced innovations over the past 5 years including a focus on supporting ESG projects, digital lending, buy-now-pay later programs, and embedded finance.

Asset management has seen an evolution in custom indexing which combines individual management strategies like diversification, factor exposure, passive beta, personal restrictions , tax loss harvesting, and ESG into a single platform. Custom indexing empowers investors to build individually tailored portfolios specific to their goals and needs.

They are a major player in the financial domain due to the commitment to a high level of customer service and strong brand image and stronger client base.

## Results

John Pierpont Morgan whom is regarded as the original founder of J.P. Morgan Chase impacted serial major railroad networks, financed industrial consolidations that eventually formed US Steel, International Harvester, and General Electric. Not only did he finance these major corporations he also helped achieve railroad rate stability. Through gaining control of the stock in these major railroad operations he became one of the worlds the largest railroad magnates rivaling Andrew Carnegie's railroad empire.

More recently in October 2020 JP Morgan Chase released a $30 billion commitment to Racial Equity to help close the racial wealth gap among Black, Hispanic, and Latino communities. So far JP Morgan has committed $13 billion of their original $30 billion commitment. Their focus in this effort is on mortgage refinancing, homeownership, affordable rental housing, growing minority small businesses, maintaining financial health of minority account holders at their commercial banks, investing in minority depository institutions (MDI) and community development financial institutions (CDFI), as well as helping the minority workforce and overall philanthropy.


Some metrics that J.P. Morgan Chase uses to measure success are total net revenue in their consumer, corporate, commercial, and asset management sectors. They also measure total income generated from investment banking fees, mortgage fees, credit card income, and lending/deposit fees to name a few.

Based on the previously mentioned metrics J.P. Morgan has had over 11% expected growth in credit card income in 2022 as compared to 2021 and just under 120% in expected growth in their corporate sector. Other metrics like consumer, commercial, asset management had much smaller expected growth at between .6% - 1.5%. Not all metrics had positive returns comparing year over year investment banking, lending and deposit fees, and corporate year over year earnings dropped between -.77% - 3.2%.


* Comparing JP Morgan(JPM) to Wells Fargo(WFC), Bank of America(BAC) in 2022 JPM has been declining for 13 months when as BAC and WFC had declined for 8 months. Overall net revenue has grown by 1% in the second quarter year-on-year but overall expense has also grown by 6%. JP Morgan has been an industry leader as compared to their competitors on the sole fact that they have successfully merged commercial banking and investment banking.


* When comparing JP Morgan with Goldman Sachs which is another largely respected investment bank, JP Morgan shares rose 148% over the past five years and Goldman Sachs experienced a 131% increase. Both JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs outperformed S&P 500 with a return 125% over the past years.

Even though JP Morgan's market cap is more than 3.5 times the size of Goldman Sachs, Goldman pays a higher dividend of 2.83% as compared to JP Morgan's 2.8%


# Recommendations

* As fintech is disrupting the financial sector innovations like peer-to-peer lending, equity crowdfunding, cryptocurrencies, blockchain, digital wealth advising, trading platforms, and mobile payment systems. Since JP Morgan recently applied for a patent to launch their own digital wealth advisor dubbed InvestGPT, I would suggest implementing blockchain technology into their processes. 

*Blockchain would be useful to their business because not only does it increase security due to the reduced need for data intermediaries and inefficient monopolistic utilities, using the Etherium blockchain eliminates the risk of being hacked from unwanted accounts and users. High level security without performance to match it means a system competes with ever evolving hackers that are on the hunt.

As JP Morgan is not only a investment bank they are heavily involved in sales and trading to make sure their winners are larger than their losses, as blockchain replaces human and risk of fraud although operational is minimized, overall counter party risk is decreased. 

Not only does blockchain integration mitigate most counter party risk, real time verification and digitized authentication like KYC facilitate sharing financial documents accurately, safely, and securely.

* I believe these implementations would benefit JP Morgan because with the large amount of money being moved at any one point and high volume trading operations, implementing a technology that is built off digitization of financial instruments and assets better sharpen JP Morgan's edge in the market.



* Blockchain technology utilizes hashing and encryption and the SHA256 algorithm store data securely. The SHA256 algorithm is nearly impossible to hack the unique has encryption.

Each block in the blockchain can be further broken down into 4 main headers: Previous hash, transactional details, nonce, and the hash address of the block. Attempting to discover the correct hash value that matches with a predetermined condition is known as proof of work, a rewarding venture if equipped with the necessary skill set.

* Without blockchain adoption and implementation JP Morgan may risk losing global market share due to competing banks in the sector taking advantage of the changing and newly emerging opportunities created everyday by foreign investors. Even though in the current global economic landscape only a handful of countries have adopted blockchain and cryptocurrencies into their national economy. Once we reach mass adoption, banks and institutions that don't deal in crypto will be left behind. El Salvador became the first country to fully adopt bitcoin as their legal tender since September 2021. Although 60% of the original recipients of the free bitcoin have not have transacted with the cryptocoin since spending it, 20% have yet to spend the one free bitcoin they received.
